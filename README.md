### Summary

This project is a quick game that uses the following technologies.

+ Yarn
+ Vue 2.5
+ cli 3
+ flexbox

I also use an Event Bus architecture for component communication. I subscribe to my
EventBus much the same as subscribing to an observable. The game works and I achieved
the challenge objectives without directed help from the Udemy course community.

I am unaware of the shortcomings of using my EventBus and how this affects performance
of my game, or weather this kind of architecture or solution is used in production.
